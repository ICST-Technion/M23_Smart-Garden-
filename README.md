created by Omar_asadi 29/08/23. 
repo with soil moisture and air temperature sensors connected to firebase. 
in this repo, we have three files:
the first one: a file for DHT11 sensor connected to ESP32, which helps to read values from the sensor (air tempreature and humidaty) 
the second file: for doil moisture sensor, that helps also to read data from the sensor. 
the third and the last file, integrate both file, to excute read in parallel and uploading the data into the firebase.
